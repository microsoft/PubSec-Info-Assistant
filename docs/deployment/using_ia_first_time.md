# Using IA Accelerator for the first time

Once you have successfully deployed the IA Accelerator, you are ready to use the accelerator to process some data.

To use the IA Accelerator, you need to follow these steps:

> 1. Prepare your data and upload it to Azure.
>
>       * Your data must be in a specified format to be valid for processing. See our [supported document types in the Feature documentation](/docs/features/features.md#document-pre-processing).
>       * Upload your data [via the data upload user interface](/docs/features/user_experience.md#uploading-files).
> 2. Once uploaded the system will automatically process and make the document(s) available to you and other users of the deployment.
> 3. Begin [having conversations with your data](/docs/features/user_experience.md#having-a-conversation-with-your-data) by selecting the appropriate interaction method.

For more detailed information review the [Features](/docs/features/features.md) section of the documentation.
