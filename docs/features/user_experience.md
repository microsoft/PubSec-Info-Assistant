# User Experience

The end user leverages the web interface as the primary method to engage with the IA Accelerator, and the Azure OpenAI service. The user interface is very similar to that of the OpenAI ChatGPT interface, though it provides different and additional functionality which is outlined below.

## Having a conversation with your data

When you engage with IA Accelerator in the "Chat" method, the system maintains a history for your conversation and will be able to understand the context of your questions from one question to the next.

> You may activate the Chat engagement pattern by choosing the "Chat" link at the top of the page

## Analysis Panel

The Analysis Panel in the UX allows the user to explore three details about the answer to their question:

* Thought Process
* Supporting Content
* [Citations](/docs/features/ux_analysispanel.md#citations)

View the details of the [Analysis Panel](/docs/features/ux_analysispanel.md) feature or you can click on each section to get more specifics of that detail tab.

## Manage Content

When you engage with IA Accelerator in the "Manage Content" method, the system allows you to add new content and see the status of processing for content previously loaded into the IA Accelerator.
