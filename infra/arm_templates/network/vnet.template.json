#Explanation
#1. Virtual Network: Replaced Azure Virtual Network with a Docker Compose network configuration.
#2. Subnets: Defined subnets within the Docker Compose network configuration, each with a specific IP address.
#This configuration sets up a virtual network with various subnets, similar to the original ARM template but adapted for on-premises deployment using Docker Compose. Each subnet is assigned a specific IP address within the defined network range.
