#Explanation
#1.	MinIO Service: This service runs a MinIO instance, which is an on-premises alternative to Azure Blob Storage.
#2. Environment Variables: MINIO_ROOT_USER and MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD are used to set the root user and password for MinIO.
#3. Command: The server /data command starts the MinIO server with the data directory.
#4. Ports: The service maps port 9000 on the host to port 9000 on the container.
#5. Volumes: The minio_data volume is used to persist data.
#This Docker Compose file sets up a MinIO instance to handle object storage, similar to how Azure Blob Storage would be used in the original ARM template.
