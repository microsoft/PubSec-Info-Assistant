export AZURE_ENVIRONMENT="AzureCloud"
# Update to "true" if you want to deploy the solution in a "secure" mode. The secure mode requires extra permissions and will require
# the user to have special access. In the "secure" mode, traffic within the Information Assistant will not use public endpoints.
export SECURE_MODE=false
# Update to "true" if you want to deploy the solution with the ability to use the Work + Web Chat feature.
# This feature will allow users to use web based search results to be a data source for grounding in the chat.
# Web Chat feature IS NOT supported in AZURE_ENVIRONMENT="AzureUSGovernment"
export ENABLE_WEB_CHAT=false
# If you are enabling the Web Chat feature, you can update the following values to "true" to enable safe search for the Bing data source.
# Defaults to true if not defined.
export ENABLE_BING_SAFE_SEARCH=true
# Update to "true" if you want to deploy the solution with the ability to use the Generative Chat feature.
# This feature will allow users to use native responses from the LLM without any data source for grounding in the chat.
export ENABLE_UNGROUNDED_CHAT=false
# Update to "true" if you want to deploy the solution with the ability to use the Math Assistant feature.
# This feature will allow users to use the Math Assistant feature to solve math problems.
export ENABLE_MATH_ASSISTANT=true
# Update to "true" if you want to deploy the solution with the ability to use the Tabular Data Assistant feature.
# This feature will allow users to use the Tabular Data Assistant feature to chat with CSV files.
export ENABLE_TABULAR_DATA_ASSISTANT=true
# Update to "true" if you want to deploy the solution with the ability to ingest data from SharePoint sites.
# This feature will allow users to use the SharePoint connector to ingest documents from folders in SharePoint.
export ENABLE_SHAREPOINT_CONNECTOR=false
# If the SharePoint connector is enabled, use the following settings for a list of sharepoint sites and folders you want to index. 
# This is a SINGLE QUOTED JSON Object Array containing each sharepoint site and the corresponding entry folder
# Example: '[
#    { "url": "https://yoursharepoint.com", "folder": "/Shared Documents/YourFolder"},
#    { "url": "https://yoursharepoint.com", "folder": "/Shared Documents/YourFolder2"}
#    ]'
# The app will crawl down from the folder specified into subfolders and files
# The forward slash for at the beginning of the folder is required i.e. "/Shared Documents"
# Specifying the root folder of "/Shared Documents" will crawl all your documents in your sharepoint site
